Spring AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming 


Limitation of Procedure language is 
in Procedure langauge we will focus more on functionality rather than properties or state. 

But in OOPs language we wil focus more on properties or state rather than functionality. 

AOP : AOP focus on funtionality 

funtionality divided into two parts 
1. primary functionality or core concern 
2. secondary functionality or cross cutting 

		Banking 
			checkBalance 
			withdraw 
			deposite 
					etc 

		login 
		database connection 
		security 
		etc 

AOP it allow the separation of the cross cutting concern. 
AOP terminology 
1. Aspect : An aspect is a module that encapsulated advice and point cut. It provide cross cutting. 

2. pointcut : A point is a expression language that use to select the one or more join points where advice is executed. 

3. Joint point : A join piont is a point in the application or program where we can apply AOP aspect. 

4. Advice : The advice is an action that we take eitehr before or after or both actual method execution.
